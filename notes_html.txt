HTML CSS
-CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
-Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.
-The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also 
apply to all children elements within the parent. (unless you specify something else)!
-CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
-An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.
 An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.
-An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.
-An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page,
within a <style> element.
-An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.
-To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:
-The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension
- With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire web site, by changing one file!
    css colors, fonts and sizes 
-The CSS color property defines the text color to be used
-The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.
-The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.
    css border
-The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.
-You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.
border:2px solid powderblue;
    css padding
-The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.
    css margin
-The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.(up,down,left and right)
    Link to external css
-<link>	Defines a link between a document and an external resource
-External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/html/styles.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">


HTML classes
-The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.
-Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.
-The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet.
-The class attribute can be used on any HTML element.
-The class name is case sensitive!
-To create a class; write a period (.) character, followed by a class name. 
Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
-HTML elements can belong to more than one class.
-To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, 
e.g. <div class="city main">. 
The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.
-Different HTML elements can point to the same class name

HTML id
-The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
-You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document. The 
value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
-The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet.
-The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. 
Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.
-The id name is case sensitive
-The id name must contain at least one character, cannot start with a number, 
and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).

HTML <div>
-The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document
-The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then 
styled with CSS.
-The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
-By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the <div> element.

HTML <span>
-The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, 
or a part of a document.
-The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level 
element and <span> is an inline element.
-The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated  using the class or id attribute.
-Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag!
